# Agent Personas

This directory contains AI agent persona definitions used in the Ambient Code Platform for multi-agent collaboration scenarios.

## Active Agents

Currently used agents in RFE workflows and agentic sessions:

- **[Amber](active/amber.md)** - Automation agent for GitHub issue-to-PR workflows
- **[Parker](active/parker-product_manager.md)** - Product Manager persona

## Archived Agents

Additional agent personas in holding pattern for future use:

See the [archived/](archived/) directory for agents that are defined but not currently active in workflows. These agents were part of an earlier, more expansive agent framework and may be reintegrated in future iterations as workflows expand.

**Agent Bullpen Philosophy:**  
The archived agents represent various roles across product management, engineering, UX, content, and agile practices. They're preserved here to support future multi-agent scenarios as the platform evolves.

## Using Agents

Agents are referenced in:
- Multi-agent collaboration workflows
- RFE (Request For Enhancement) processing
- Agentic session prompts with role-based personas

See `CLAUDE.md` for information on how agents are utilized in Claude Code sessions.
